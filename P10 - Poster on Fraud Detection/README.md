Credit fraud is the criminal use of someone else's personal credentials, as well as their credit standing, to borrow money or use credit cards to purchase goods or services with no intention of repaying the debt.  
In this project, I have created a poster & a paper which will highlight the importance of Fraud detection in Credit Card Industry.
