Credit card fraud was ranked number one type of identity theft fraud. Each year financial institutions lose a significant amount of money as a result of credit card fraud. Due to increase in fraud rates, researchers have started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyze frauds in online transactions. In year 2018, a total of $24.26 Billion was lost due to payment card fraud across the globe and United States being the most fraud prone country.  
This project intends to create a model for credit card fraud detection using past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be a fraud.
