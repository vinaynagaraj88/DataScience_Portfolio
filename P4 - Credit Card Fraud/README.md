Credit card fraud was ranked number one type of identity theft fraud. Each year financial institutions lose a significant amount of money as a result of credit card fraud. Due to increase in fraud rates, researchers have started using different machine learning methods to detect and analyze frauds in online transactions.  
This project intends to create a model for credit card fraud detection using past credit card transactions with the knowledge of the ones that turned out to be a fraud.
