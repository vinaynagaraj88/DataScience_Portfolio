A general assumption when we think about the safety during transportation is that Road travel is better than Air travel. Most of the time people think Air travel is riskier. After all, an air crash is catastrophic, with more loss of life, injury and property damage than a car accident. But is it true?  
Airline accidents are highly publicized when they occur however airline accidents are extremely rare. These accidents are so rare that airline travel is statistically the safest mode of transportation overall.  

This project creates various visualizations based on actual data to determine how safe is Airline travel. It provides a picture that Airline travel is the safest mode of transportation and is much safest when compared to automobiles which usually is the preferred mode.

#### Blog Post

I have written a [Blog](https://dsc640-vinaynagaraj.blogspot.com/2021/02/air-travel-is-this-safe.html) on the safety of Airline travel. It has some interesting information about Airline Travel and its safety.
