<ul>
<li>The 3 CSV files from the different sources were read and was merged using merge() and ‘inner’ join.</li>
<li>Fuzzy matching technique was used to merge the Wikipedia data and the Google API data. Book Name &amp; Author was used as a key and a threshold of 95. This merged dataframe was then loaded into the SQLite database.</li>
<li>Kaggle data was loaded to the database and then the above merged data was then merged with the Kaggle data using ‘Inner’ join.</li>
<li>The data was then read from the database to create Visualizations.</li>
